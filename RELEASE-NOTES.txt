Upgrade Notes
 See the openAS2HowTo appendix for the general process on upgrading OpenAS2.
 Below are some specific things to focus on depending on which version you are upgrading from.
 You must review all notes for the relevant intermediate versions from your version to this release version. 

    If upgrading from versions older than 2.4.1:
      1. If you have developed custom modules to enhance OpenAS2 they will need to be upgraded to include a healthcheck() method.
    If upgrading from versions older than 2.3.0:
      1. If using a custom startup script, re-integrate your customizations into the new script as the jar file for OpenAS2 is now tagged with its release version. (use asterisk [*] in classpath)
    If upgrading from versions older than 2.1.0:
      1. Add the new module to your existing config.xml (see classname="org.openas2.processor.msgtracking.DbTrackingModule" in release config.xml)
      2. If using a custom startup script, re-integrate your customizations into the new script
      3. As of 2.3.1 the log date format was changed to international standard. If you have log processing utilities that rely on a specific date format then you must change as needed (see documentation for mechanism)
  
Java 1.6 or later is required.

NOTE FOR JAVA 1.5: No longer supported. Use a version prior to 2.2.0 to run on Java 1.5

NOTE FOR JAVA 1.6: 
	The version of H2 database included in this release used for storing tracking messages will only support Java 1.7.
	If you do not need the DB tracking feature then simply remove it from the config.xml file.
	Otherwise:
		- download the older version of H2 that was compiled with support for Java 1.6 from this site:
			https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/h2database/h2-2014-01-18.zip
		- Extract the file named h2-1.3.175.jar from the zip and replace the h2-1.4.192.jar in the "lib" folder with this one.
		- Change the startup script to include the replaced version of H2 jar in the classpath
		- Start OpenAS2 (required to run next statement successfully) and import the DDL (located in the config folder as db_ddl.sql) into the DB created by the older version like this:
			java -cp [path to OpenAS2 install]/lib/h2-1.3.175.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -user sa -password OpenAS2 -url jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/openas2 -script [path to OpenAS2 install]/config/db_ddl.sql
